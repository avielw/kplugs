======

KPlugs is a Linux kernel module which provides an interface for dynamically executing scripts inside the Linux kernel.
KPlugs uses a simple bytecode interpreter (the KPlugs Virtual Machine), and an interface that allows a user to dynamically load scripts into the kernel and execute them directly from user space. Because the interface is dynamic, it's easy to implement a user-mode library that wraps anything in the kernel.

KPlugs comes with a Python library that compiles a subset of the Python language to the KPlugs bytecode, and lets you easily load and execute your "kernel Python script".
